    Run opencv to find where the frickin special blocks (as in how many blocks from the left/right they are)[therefore finding where the other block is and finding out what code we are running]

    if situation 1: run code to get to the leftmost block situation 1

    if situation 2: run code to get to the leftmost block situation 2

    if situation 3: run code to get to the leftmost block situation 3

    Intake the leftmost block [depends on the fricken robot design] (try not to knock and other blocks over)

    Turn 90 degrees right or left towards the foundation

    Go forward to the foundation


            Put the special block in the foundation

            REVERSE until youâ€™re in front of the 2nd special block

            Turn right/left towards the block

            Grab the block (Make sure the hand is positioned correctly)

    Turn 90 degrees back to the building site

    Go to the foundation

    Place the block on the foundation

    go right to the middle of the field

    go forward between the two foundations

    turn 90 degrees toward the foundation

    grab the foundation

    push it forward into the building site

    release the foundation

    360 so you are facing the opposite wall

    if time:
    go right to the blocks

    grab a block

    turn 90 degrees toward the foundation

    go forward to the foundation

    drop the block in the foundation

    reverse until the robot is under the bridge
